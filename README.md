**Date Transformer 2000**

Allows you to input datetimes in all kinds of different formats and get both human-readable and iso8601 datetimes in timezones that we care a lot about!

## To-do:
- copy-on-click for times
- add local timezone support
- travel to random timezones for... testing
- Add seconds? https://github.com/spencermountain/spacetime/issues/70
- Allow time (instead of date or datetime) input
- Allow setting locale
- General cleanup
